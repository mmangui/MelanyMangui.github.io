								<p style="color: #bf5a12ea">Passionate about data, visualizations and solving problems.</p>
								<h2 style="color: #0a477d"> My journey as a data analyst step by step:</h2>
								<br>
								<center>
									<h3 style="color: #0a477d"> Step One: Sociology Meets Data
								</center>
								<h4 align="justify"> My data adventure began 7 years ago with my work as a sociologist with Spain's Health Department. </h4>
								<h4 align="justify"> In my initial project there, I worked with colleagues focused on implementing improved formats for compiling relevant and efficient statistics for health systems databases. </h4>
								<h4 align="justify"> Expanding on my qualitative research skills, I had the joy to work with different types of methods using statistical comparison techniques, ad-hoc analysis, and data harmonization processes.</h4>
								<h4 align="justify">I was inspired by the power of the collected data and how its analysis was able to impact decision-making at a broad and minute scale. Just like that, I had found my career path!  </h4>
								<center>
									<h3 style="color: #0a477d"> Step Two: Falling in Love with Analysis and Visualization
									
								</center>
								<h4 align="justify"> I made the transition from sociology to marketing, where I knew I would be exposed the intersection of data and people. I began working as a junior marketing consultant while I dedicated my time to pursuing top-level skills and knowledge</h4>
								<h4 align="justify"> Within two years, I obtained certifications in SQL & Python on platforms like CodeAcademy and Udemy, and I completed my master’s in Marketing. I was able to gain a wealth of knowledge in a variety of concepts, including: Conversion Click-Through Rate (CTR), Engagement Rate (CTA), Bounce Rate, A/B Testing, and visualization tools like Tableau and PowerBI. </p> 
								<center>
									<h3 style="color: #0a477d"> Step Two: Falling in Love with Analysis and Visualization
								</center>
								<h4 align="justify"> My first major foray into this industry was through research opportunities with the Spanish government. I was initially tasked with projects in data analysis and transparency before transitioning into work with the Mental Health Department.</h4>
								<h4 align="justify"> For over two years, I worked with a team to analyze the efficiency and efficacy of government aid services using a variety of analysis and visualization tools like Excel, VBA, SQL, and Tableau to retrieve, clean, and harmonize the data. </h4>
								<h4 align="justify"> This project was particularly eye-opening and meaningful – both at a professional and personal level; however, I wanted to learn more about other types of markets and sectors, and fully engage my Marketing skills and knowledge.</h4>
								<center>
									<h3 style="color: #0a477d"> Step Four: Business Data Analyst</h3>
									<p style="color: #bf5a12ea"> Working with e-commerce, content creators (Youtubers), startups and Survived!</p>
								</center>
								<h4 align="justify"> Two years ago, I dove headfirst into freelance consulting work with a number of startups and e-commerce sites, youtubers, and even an automotive company in need of business data analysis. I have excelled at freelancing by relying on the same familiar tools – as well as others, like, WordPress data, YouTube analytics, AWS, Salesforce, and SAP. </h5>
								<h4 align="justify"> With over seven years of extensive hands-on experience in data and research analysis, I am confident in my abilities to help you understand, maintain, and further your company’s success. Let’s take that next step together! </h4>
